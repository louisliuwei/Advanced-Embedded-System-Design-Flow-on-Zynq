## Prepare for the Multi-Applications Boot Using SD Card        
### The lab1 and lab3 executable files are required in the .bin format before copying to the SD card. The area in memory allocated for each application need to be modified so that they do not overlap each other, or with the main application. The prepared bin files provided in the directory: {sources}\lab5\[pynqz1 or pynqz2]\SDCard can be used for copying to the SD card. Follow steps in Appendix A-1 and A-2 if you want to generate by yourself.

## Create the SD Card Image and Test
### Using the Windows Explorer, create the SD\_image directory under the lab5 directory. You will first need to create the bin files from lab1 and lab3.
1. Using the Windows Explorer, create directory called **SD\_image** under the **lab5** directory.
1. In Windows Explorer, copy the **system\_wrapper.bit** of the lab1 project into the _SD\_image_ directory and rename it _lab1.bit_, and do similar for lab3

    {labs}/lab1/lab1.runs/impl\_1/system\_wrapper.bit -&gt; SD\_image /lab1.bit

    {labs}/lab3/lab3.runs/impl\_1/system\_wrapper.bit -&gt; SD\_image /lab3.bit

    The XSDK _bootgen_ command will be used to convert the bit files into the required binary format. bootgen requires a .bif file which has been provided in the sources/lab5 directory. The .bif file specifies the target .bit files.

1. Open a command prompt by selecting **Xilinx &gt; Launch Shell.**
1. In the command prompt window, change the directory to the bitstreams directory.

    cd {labs}/lab5/SD\_image

1. Generate the partial bitstream files in the BIN format using the provided &quot;.bif&quot; file located in the _sources_ directory. Use the following command:

    bootgen -image ../ ../ ../2018\_2\_zynq\_sources/lab5/bit\_files.bif -w -process\_bitstream bin

1. Rename the files _lab1.bit.bin_ and _lab3.bit.bin_ to _lab1.bin_ and _lab3.bin_
1. The size of the file needs to match the size specified in the **lab5\_sd.c** file. The size can be determined by checking the file&#39;s properties. If the sizes do not match, then make the necessary change to the source code and save it (The values are defined as LAB1\_BITFILE\_LEN and LAB3\_BITFILE\_LEN).

### This step bring in MULTIBOOT register related code in Lab3. It then convert the lab3  executable file to the required (.bin) format. 
### Switch workspace to lab3.sdk directory. Define MULTIBOOT symbol, create Zynq\_fsbl application, and change the lab3 BSP reference to zynq\_fsbl\_bsp. Create the image using the zynq\_fsbl.elf, system\_wrapper.bit, and lab3.elf files and naming it as lab3.bin in the lab3 directory.
1. In the **SDK** program switch the workspace by selecting **File &gt; Switch Workspace &gt; Otherâ€¦** and browse to the workspace pointing to **{labs}\lab3\lab3.sdk\** and click **OK.**
1. Right-click on the **lab3** entry, select the _C/C++ Build Settings_ option.
1. Select _Symbols_ in the left pane under the _ARM gcc compiler_ group, click the _+_ button on the right, enter **MULTIBOOT** in open form, click **OK** , and click **OK** again.

    The application will re-compile as the MULTIBOOT related code is now included.

1. Select **File** &gt; **New** &gt; **Application Project**
